# a holo fighting game

## ideology

this is not an anime fighting game. this game is grounded and does not have very long combos.
the commands should be accessible enough to casual players.


## common mechanics

### movement
- double tap forward to dash (20f)
- double tap back to dash (20f)
- 3 direction jump (40f)

### parry & tp
- while parrying, double tap forward to tp forward
- while parrying, double tap jump to tp up forward
- tp goes maximum distance of 2000, appearing in front of opponent
- if tp from point blank, appears behind opponent
- up forward tp is considered forward jump for jumping moves
- attacks can be done 10f after tp-ing
- double tapping fwd (or tapping parry) during a cancelable normal to tp cancel forward
- double tapping jump during cancelable normal to tp cancel up forward
- tp cancel goes into freeze immediately with no startup

### normals
- all normal moves can be canceled into another normal move that is equal or higher strength as long as its not the same input
- all normal moves can be special / super / tp canceled unless it knocks down
- 2H always knocks down
- 6H is slow, and always cause a stun on punish counter (does not knock down)

### target combos
- only certain target combos can be canceled

### special moves
- special moves can either be done with command inputs, or direction + s button
- when done using alias, does 20% less dmg
- only certain special moves can be super canceled
- jump normals can only be canceled into jump specials
- forward or back grab, can grab parrying opponents

### super
- super 1 is 214s, super 2 is 236s

### autocombos
- optional: give an easier way to play? but limit effectiveness
- holding auto and mashing l gives 5l 5m 5h special
- holding auto and mashing m / h gives character specific combo into super 1 / 2
- 20% reduced damage
- autocombo advances even on block (to prevent brainded mashing)

### meter
- super meter is 3 bars of 1000 each
- each attack raises meter
- blocking / getting hit / blocked attacks raise less meter
- parrying has small initial cost and slowly drains
- tp uses 0.5 bars of meter
- tp cancel uses 0.75 bars of meter
- successful attack parry gives 150% of meter gain
- super 1 / 2 use 1 / 2 bars respectively
